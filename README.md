# Automation-Backup
 This is a Backup Automation project that creates Backup data for preferenced data automatically

IMPORTANT
1. Inorder to have the project functioning well, you have to install the schedule module in the terminal. this can be simply done with "pip install schedule"
2. Your source variable should be linked to a directory that has data already in it as this directory is the directory you want your data backed up
3. Depending on your preferences you can edit the time and date in the code to satisfy your needs

Practicality: 
The project can function well and can actually be viable in everydays life, but can only function if you keep the code running all the time while using your computer. It is practical if your doing several tasks and constantly saving data in a certain directory. If you want these data backed up but being lazy to constantly and manually secure them, then this code can be helpful.

HOWEVER the code logically needs to be "run" manually everytime you restart your pc or boot it. The code does not run automatically when you start your computer.
